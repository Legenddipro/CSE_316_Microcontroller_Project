# CSE_316_Microcontroller_Project
## Functionalities
- **Object Detection**: The system can detect objects of 3 types such as apple, orange and banana
- **Object Classification**: The system can classify the detected objects into their respective categories and sort them into their dedicated bins
- **Weight Measurement**: The system can measure the weight of the detected objects and display it on the LCD
- **Counting**: The system can count the number of objects detected and display the count on the LCD
## Components Used
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno, ATmega32
- **Sensors**: Load cell, HX711 IC
- **Display**: LCD 16x2
- **Camera**: We connect phone camera to the laptop . By using the camera we can detect the objects
- **Motor**: Servo motor for sorting the objects into bins, DC motor for rotating the conveyor belt
- **Power Supply**: 9V Adaptor, one holder containing 2 3.7V rechargeable batteries
